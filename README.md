# LSMM
This repository is the official implementation of the paper:  
“Jun-Xiang Mao, Jun-Yi Hang, Min-Ling Zhang. Learning Label-Specific Multiple Local Metrics for Multi-Label Classification. In: Proceedings of the 33th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'24), Jeju Island, South Korea.”

***

## Requirement
- MATLAB 2022b 
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox  12.4
- Bioinformatics Toolbox 4.16.1
- Parallel Computing Toolbox  7.7
***

To start, create a directory of your choice and copy the code there. 

Set the path in your MATLAB to add the directory you just created.

## Guideline
This repository provides detailed implementations about our proposed **LSMM-SE** and **LSMM-CL** approaches. Just run the corresponding .m files directly.

- LSMM_Se_BRKNN.m  
This file provides the implementation of BR-KNN coupled with LSMM-SE.

- LSMM_Se_MLKNN.m  
This file provides the implementation of ML-KNN coupled with LSMM-SE.

- LSMM_Cl_BRKNN.m  
This file provides the implementation of BR-KNN coupled with LSMM-Cl.

- LSMM_Cl_MLKNN.m  
This file provides the implementation of ML-KNN coupled with LSMM-Cl.
